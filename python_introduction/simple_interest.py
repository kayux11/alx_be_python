# Define the variables in the problem

principal = 1000 # respresents $1000
rate = 0.05 # represents 5% annual interest rate
time = 3 # represents 3yrs

# Calculate simple interest using the formula I = P * R * T
Interest = principal * rate * time
# print the calculated interest using the specified format
print(f"The simple interest is: {Interest}")
